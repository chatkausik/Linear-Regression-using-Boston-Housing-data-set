# Linear-Regression-using-Boston-Housing-data-set

This is a very quick run-through of some basic statistical concepts, adapted from Lab 4 in Harvard's CS109 course.

Linear Regression Models
Prediction using linear regression
Some re-sampling methods
Train-Test splits
Cross Validation

Linear regression is used to model and predict continuous outcomes while logistic regression is used to model binary outcomes. We'll see some examples of linear regression as well as Train-test splits.

The packages we'll cover are: statsmodels, seaborn, and scikit-learn. While we don't explicitly teach statsmodels and seaborn in the Springboard workshop, those are great libraries to know.
